# PZpipe
ZPAQ streaming and multithreaded compressor/decompressor

The idea is to have the piping capabilities of ZPIpe and the multithreading capabilities of PZpaq at the same time.

Pretty rudimentary for not, is just a retrofitted version of my ZPAQ compression support for Precomp, but as a standalone program.
